# Deployment Fix Documentation

## Problem Analysis

### Issue 1: Website Not Loading
**Root Cause:** The application was converted to a React SPA (Single Page Application), but the external JavaScript modules referenced by React components were not being included in the production build.

**Symptoms:**
- Website loads but shows blank page
- Browser console shows 404 errors for `/src/js/*.js` files
- React components fail to initialize their interactive functionality

### Issue 2: Available Tasks Not Working
**Root Cause:** The task links were using standard HTML anchor tags (`<a href="page.html">`) instead of React Router's `<Link>` components, and the referenced JavaScript files were missing from the build output.

**Symptoms:**
- Clicking on task cards would result in 404 errors
- Direct navigation to task URLs would not work
- No task functionality would load

## Solution Implemented

### Step 1: Copy Static Assets to Public Folder
Moved all vanilla JavaScript modules and CSS files to the `public/src/` directory so that Vite includes them in the build output:

```bash
public/
  src/
    js/           # All vanilla JS modules
    styles/       # All CSS files
```

**Why this works:** Vite copies everything from the `public/` folder directly to `dist/` during build, making these files accessible at runtime.

### Step 2: Updated React Components
All React page components (Questionnaire, DistanceConverter, DataProcessor, AsteroidFinder) dynamically load their respective JavaScript modules using `useEffect`:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const scripts = ['/src/js/module1.js', '/src/js/module2.js'];
  scripts.forEach(src => {
    const script = document.createElement('script');
    script.src = src;
    document.body.appendChild(script);
  });
  return () => {
    // Cleanup scripts on unmount
  };
}, []);
```

### Step 3: React Router Integration
- Converted all `<a>` tags to `<Link>` components from react-router-dom
- Configured proper routing in `App.tsx` with BrowserRouter
- Added `_redirects` file for hosting platform SPA support

### Step 4: Hosting Configuration
Created configuration files to ensure proper SPA routing on hosting platforms:

**For Netlify/Vercel** (`public/_redirects`):
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

**For Vercel** (`vercel.json`):
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Build Output Structure

```
dist/
  ├── index.html                    # Main entry point
  ├── _redirects                    # SPA routing config
  ├── assets/
  │   ├── index-[hash].js          # React bundle
  │   └── index-[hash].css         # Compiled styles
  └── src/
      ├── js/                       # Vanilla JS modules
      │   ├── questionnaire.js
      │   ├── asteroid-finder.js
      │   ├── data-processor/
      │   └── distance-converter/
      └── styles/                   # Individual CSS files
          ├── main.css
          ├── questionnaire.css
          └── ...
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Home page loads correctly
- [x] All task cards are visible and clickable
- [x] Clicking task cards navigates to correct route
- [x] Direct URL navigation works (e.g., `/questionnaire`)
- [x] Browser refresh on task pages works
- [x] All JavaScript modules load without 404 errors
- [x] All CSS styles apply correctly
- [x] Interactive functionality works on each task page

## Deployment Instructions

1. Run production build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy the `dist/` folder to your hosting platform

3. Ensure the platform is configured to:
   - Serve `index.html` for all routes (SPA mode)
   - Support the `_redirects` file (Netlify) or use provided `vercel.json` (Vercel)

## Technical Details

**Technology Stack:**
- React 18 with TypeScript
- React Router v7 for routing
- Vite for bundling
- Vanilla JavaScript modules for interactive features

**Key Files Modified:**
- `src/App.tsx` - Added React Router configuration
- `src/pages/*.tsx` - Created React wrapper components
- `public/src/` - Added vanilla JS and CSS files
- `public/_redirects` - Added SPA routing support
- `vercel.json` - Added Vercel-specific routing

## Verification

The site is now fully functional with:
1. ✅ Main page loading correctly
2. ✅ Available Tasks section displaying all 4 tasks
3. ✅ Each task link working properly
4. ✅ All interactive features functional
5. ✅ Proper routing on hosting platform
